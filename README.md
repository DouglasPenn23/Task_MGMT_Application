# Task_MGMT_Application
TASK MGMT Application as refresher of the following technologies : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, 
Tailwind CSS,  NPM, Node.js, PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs, JWT Auth and Redis.

Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account and authenticate themselves using 
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access to the app.

Responsive Frontend: The frontend of the app will be built using modern web technologies 
(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface. 
It should adapt well to different devices and screen sizes.

Task Management: Users can create tasks, set due dates, assign priorities, and add descriptions. 
They can also update and delete tasks as needed. The app should provide an intuitive and interactive 
interface for managing tasks effectively.

Task Filtering and Sorting: Users can filter and sort tasks based on various criteria, 
such as due date, priority, or status (e.g., completed, pending). 
This functionality will allow users to organize and view their tasks in a way that suits their needs.

Database Storage: The app will have a backend database to store task data. Redis will be used. 


API for Backend Operations: The backend of the app will expose a RESTful API that allows the frontend to 
interact with the database. The API endpoints will handle CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks and user-related data.

JWT Authentication: The backend API will use JWT authentication to secure the endpoints. 
Users will receive a token upon successful login, which they will include in subsequent API requests 
to authenticate themselves.

User Preferences and Profiles: Users can customize their preferences, 
such as theme selection, notification settings, and profile information. 
These settings can be stored in the database and associated with the user's account.
